# Trainee Program Project

## Overview

This project is part of a trainee program and includes implementations for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, focusing on ETL processes, data analysis, and SQL querying.

### What Was Accomplished

#### Task 1
- Developed an ETL pipeline to load student and room data.
- Implemented data storage in a PostgreSQL database.
- Created SQL queries to analyze student counts per room, age distribution, and gender breakdown.
- Enabled data export in JSON and XML formats without ORM usage.

#### Task 2
- Performed data analysis on the `adult.data.csv` dataset using Pandas, calculating statistics for gender, age, salary, and group distributions.
- Conducted NumPy exercises including sign changes, maximum values, products, filtering, and analyzed cereal calorie data from `cereal.csv`.

#### Task 3
- Wrote SQL queries for the Pagila database to:
  - Calculate the number of films per category, sorted by count in descending order.
  - Identified the top 10 actors whose films were most rented, sorted by rental count.
  - Determined the film category with the highest total rental expenditure.
  - Listed films not present in the inventory using a join-based approach.
  - Found the top 3 actors with the most appearances in "Children" category films, including ties.
  - Compiled a list of cities with active and inactive customer counts, sorted by inactive customers.
  - Analyzed film categories with the highest rental hours for cities starting with "a" and those containing "-".
- Stored queries in the `task3/pagila-queries` directory and results in `task3/results.txt`.
